                <p>
                    At just 33 years of age,<strong> Mark Elliot Zuckerberg</strong> is worth $64.2 Billion, ranking 5<sup>th</sup> in the World's billionaire's list.<br/></br/>But don't count it as a reason for him being my Idol. He's a Harward Dropout; most importantly, a self-made billionaire and a Programmer. Yeah, This is what makes him my idol.<br>
                    <br>
            Above all, he is the creator of the social networking giant, <a href="http://facebook.com" target="_blank"> <span class="fa fa-facebook"></span>acebook</a>.
                    He created this network with a vision to connect our world. And this makes me respect him more than ever.
